# Classes and Objects in C++ (OOP) - Simple Guide

## What is a Class?
A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that describe what an object will have and what it can do.  
Think of a class as a plan for a real-world thing (like a car or a student).

## What is an Object?
An **object** is an instance of a class. It has its own values for the attributes defined in the class and can use the class's methods.  
Objects are created from classes, just like you can build many cars from a single car design.

## Key Concepts

- **Attributes (Data Members):** Variables inside a class that hold information about the object (e.g., color, age).
- **Methods (Member Functions):** Functions inside a class that define what the object can do (e.g., drive, display info).
- **Access Specifiers:** Control how the members can be accessed.
  - `public`: Accessible from outside the class.
  - `private`: Only accessible inside the class.
- **Encapsulation:** Wrapping data and methods together inside a class, often hiding data from outside access.
- **Abstraction:** Showing only essential features and hiding the details.
- **Instantiation:** Creating an object from a class.

### Explanation:
- `class Car { ... };` defines a class named `Car`.
- `brand` and `year` are attributes (data members).
- `displayInfo()` is a method (member function).
- `car1` and `car2` are objects of the `Car` class.
- Each object has its own values for `brand` and `year`.

## Summary of Key Points

| Concept         | Description                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Class**       | Blueprint for objects, defines data and functions |
| **Object**      | Instance of a class with its own data and behavior |
| **Attributes**  | Variables inside a class representing data       |
| **Methods**     | Functions inside a class defining behavior        |
| **Access Specifiers** | Control access to members (`public`, `private`) |
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data and functions, hiding data         |
| **Abstraction** | Showing only necessary features, hiding details   |
